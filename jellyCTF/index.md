> Welcome to jellyCTF! This is a beginner to intermediate targeted jeopardy style CTF themed around the Virtual YouTuber Jelly Hoshiumi, intended to introduce her awatistic awesome audience to security challenges.
>
>   - Challenges are split up into categories and dynamically scored based on how many solves they have, lowering in value the more people solve them, starting at 1000 points and going down to 100 after 100 solves.
    - The flag format is standard ASCII characters wrapped in jellyCTF{}, unless specified otherwise in the challenge description.
    If you're unsure how to solve a challenge, we recommend:
>
>       1. Searching the internet for similar problems that may have CTF writeups in order to get an idea of how to solve problems.
>
>       2. For challenges with source, try grepping for jellyCTF{ to see where you want to get to tracing the code path backwards.
>
>       3. Making use of the hints system for challenges that have them.
>    - The event will run from 2024-06-10T07:00:00Z to 2024-06-24T07:00:00Z, after which the scoreboard will close and challenge source code and solutions will be released. The site and challenges will stay up until 2024-06-31T23:59:00Z. Feel free to post your own writeups after the event has ended, too.

This is the first CTF I've participated in, and by extension, this is my first time doing writeups for CTF challenges; I'll do my best and I hope you'll be patient with me :pray:

I had a blast with the CTF and I got a lot further than I expected! All challenges completed, and 18th place with 31885 points; and here I was, expecting to drop out after the first day.

I hope to get writeups for all the challenges done eventually, but for now I'll just focus on getting some of my favourites done first, and I'll be sure to link the finished writeups here:
