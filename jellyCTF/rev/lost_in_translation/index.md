# [rev] lost_in_translation

Points: 676

Difficulty: easy

So I tried making an AwaSCII translator to help with writing Awatalk, but I don't really know python so I just copied some code off the internet. The output looks fine on first glance, but when I try to use it, it doesn't work. Can you help me figure out what's wrong with it?

Due to technical limitations with AwaSCII, the flag format for this challenge is jellyCTF(awawawa)
