Difficulty: medium

my friend sent me an epic video in discord - I pasted the link into the #chal-into_the_atmosphere channel in the [jellyCTF Discord](https://discord.gg/yG37ycs8t4).

**what time was the channel the video was originally uploaded to created? (NOT when it was posted in the jellyCTF discord).**

be accurate to the nearest millisecond, use UTC, and answer in ISO8601 or unix epoch format, e.g. one of:

- 2024-04-30T17:59:00.995000+00:00
- 2024-04-30T17:59:00.995+00:00
- 2024-04-30T17:59:00.995000Z
- 2024-04-30T17:59:00.995Z
- 1714499940.995
